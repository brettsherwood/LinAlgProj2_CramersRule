    "\n",
    "Cramer's Rule, according to [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cramer%27s_rule) (the only source with a decent definition), \"is an explicit formula for the solution of a system of linear equations with as many equations as unknowns, valid whenever the system has a unique solution.\" In layman's terms, it is a formula that uses the determinant of a matrix to find the unique solution to a system of equations. It can then be used to study how the solution of $A\\bf{x} = \\bf{b}$ is affected by changes in the entries of $\\bf{b}$.\n",

    "**Cramer's Rule (as defined in our textbook)**  \n",
    "Let _A_ be an invertible $n \\times n$ matrix. For any $\\bf{b}$ in $\\mathbb{R}^n$, the unique solution $\\bf{x}$ of $A\\bf{x} = \\bf{b}$ has entries given by,\n",

    "We were curious about how fast Cramer's Rule computes as the number of equations grows. In order to do this, we had to write a piece of code that measures the amount of time it takes to solve a system of equations using Cramer's Rule as we increase the number of equations. We foundthat as the number of functions increases, the time taken to compute the solution to the system increased exponentially, leading us to conclude that Cramer's Rule is very inefficient for very large systems. Below is a written example of a system of two equtions followed by the code we developed and the results we found.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Example**\n",
    "\n",
    "We will be solving the following system using Cramer's Rule,\n",

    "    -5x_1 + 4x_2 = 8\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "First we need to convert the equations to matrices in the form $A\\bf{x} = \\bf{b}$,\n",
    "$$\n",

    "    \\bf{b} = \\left[ \\begin{array}{c} 6 \\\\ 8 \\end{array} \\right]\n",

    "    \\text{det}\\ A = \\frac{1}{(3)(4) - (-2)(-5)} \\left[ \\begin{array}{cc} 4 & 2 \\\\ 5 & 3 \\end{array} \\right] = 2\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Since the determinant is nonzero, we know the system has a unique solution. We can then continue by replacing each column of $A$ with the vector $\\bf{b}$,\n",

    "### **The Code**\n",
    "\n",
    "As with any program, we first needed to import the needed libraries. pyplot is used to graph our results which we will look at later, Numpy is used for all the matrix calculations, and time allows us to calculate the time it takes for Cramer's Rule to be calculated.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "```python\n",
    "import matplotlib.pyplot as plt  # Allows us to plot our results\n",
    "import numpy as np\n",
    "import time  # Allows access to the system clock so we can time the process\n",
    "```\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "Next we decalre some initial variables. $S$ is the maximum number of equations we calculate using Cramer's Rule, the larger the number, the longer it takes. t1 is just used as a reference to see how long the total program takes to run. Then two empty lists and initialized to store the calculated times and the corresponding matrix sizes.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "```python\n",
    "t1 = time.time()  # Only used to see the total time the whole program takes\n",
    "S = 100  # Maximum matrix size\n",
    "cramersTimesList = []  # Empty list to store the time values in\n",
    "sizeList = []  # Empty list to store the sizes of the matrices\n",
    "```\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "Now begins the nuts and bolts of the code. We only want to calculate for the specificed number of equations, $S$, so we use a for loop to achieve this. We begin the loop at 1 instead of the usual 0 because we want the first matrix to be created to be of size 1, not 0. We then use a while loop to begin constructing the $A$ matrices. $A$ is made of random integers from 0 to 10. The determinant is taken here to determine if the matrix is invertible or not. Since we need an intervible matrix to properly perform Cramer's Rule, if the generated matrix is not invertible, we skip the rest of the loop and try again with the same size matrix.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "```python\n",
    "for size in range(1,S+1):  # Start at 1 because we need to have the first matrix be of size 1, can't have one of size 0\n",
    "    detA = 0  # Looping parameter\n",
    "    while detA == 0:  # This will ensure the determinant does not equal zero, ensuring linear independance \n",
    "        \n",
    "        # Create an array (matrix) of random integers, min value is 0 by default, max value is set to 10 but can be changed\n",
    "        A = np.random.randint(10, size = [size,size])\n",
    "        detA = np.linalg.det(A)  # Find determinant of A\n",
    "       \n",
    "        # This is just in case so to not cause a divide by 0 error in the loop below. This skips the rest of this iteration and tries again,\n",
    "        # (i. e. Creates a new matrix of the same size, making sure it is invertible)\n",
    "        if detA == 0:  \n",
    "            continue\n",
    "```\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "This section of the code is where Cramer's Rule takes place. Like the above while loop, we need the matrices that are being generated to be invertible, so we keep generating new matrices if an invertible one is created. We first begin by \"starting the clock\"; we read the system time as our starting point of the process. A $\\bf{b}$ vector is generated with the size of the corresponding size of the $A$ matrix.\n",
    "\n",
    "Then for the number of columns in $A$, which is equivalent to the size of $A$ since it is a square matrix, we compute Cramer's Rule. We first copy the $A$ matrix to a new matrix $A_i$ so that we do not alter the original matrix. We then replace the $i^{th}$ column of $A$ with the $\\bf{b}$ vector. The determinants of both $A$ and $A_i$ are calculated and divided, resulted in the solution $x_i$. Now this is only one solution to one unknown of the system, the rest of the unknowns must be calculated before we stop the timer. If at any point where the determinant of $A_i = 0$, the process starts over for the same $A$ matrix.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is where my contribution took place in the process of developing the program. With the previous examples of other's work, I was able to make this process work into a loop and make it work an arbitrary sized matrix.\n",

    "After an invertible $A$ is constructed and every $A_i$ is invertible, the time is took Cramer's Rule to compute is added to the list of times and the correspoding size is added to the size list.

We convert the lists because pyplot expects arrays as arguments when plotting data. The total time that the program took to run is printed out and then the data is graphed and shown.

    "*These tests were performed on the RRCC Datalab server which is why the times are so long, the image of the code output above was taken on my personal machine which is why the total run time was only 14 seconds for $S = 200$, but the method of testing she used is consistent with the data.*\n",

    "Stacy performed a quadratic and an exponential regression of the data that had very good R-values, meaning that the regression fit the data also exactly. Seen below, I also performed an additional quartic regression of the data that was a near perfect match. I did this to satisfy my own curiousity given that the complexity of our program is $\\mathcal{O}(n^4)$. This means that as $n$ increases, the time the program takes approximately $n^4$ longer to run! Now there is a large number of things that can affect this number such as the size of the inputs in the program, the hardware of the computer, etc. This also means that the error attributed to this function is very small. This leads to the conclusion that Cramer's Rule, as useful as it is, does not perform very well with large systems of equations.\n",

    "### **Conclusion**\n",
    "\n",
    "We set out to develop a program to allow us to see the affect of an increase in the number of equations on the computation time of Cramer's Rule and I believe we succeeded in this goal. We were able to visually see the increase in time taken to compute Cramer's Rule as the size of the matrix increased and we were able to use calculate the total rule time of the program to analze similar data. Through this data and the output of the program, we can see that Cramer's Rule is more suited for smaller matrices that can be computed faster. \n",
    "\n",
    "Now, this is not the only reason that Cramer's Rule is better suited for smaller matrices. When testing the code, I increased the $S$ value up to 500, which in terms of \"big data\" is a very small matrix. But I began to run into overflow issues when computing the determinant. I believe this could be resolved by manipulating the matrices in some way, possibly by factorization since det $(AB) =$ det $(A)$ det $(B)$. This could prevent an overflow issue by splitting up the determinant value into smaller values and dividing those instead. This leads me to my next observation, I would occasionaly receive an error when dividing the determinants of the matrices. After some researching, it is due to the determinants boths being very large numbers. There are manipulations to work around this, but for our purposes I did not attempt to implement one.\n",
    "\n",
    "Overall, this project proved to be an excellent learning experience and allowed me to gain some valuable insights into Cramer's Rule and program complexity."
